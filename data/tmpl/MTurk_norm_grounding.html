  <div>
      Given the <b>conversation scenario</b> below, please take a moment to grasp the main idea of what is essentially going on:
      <pre>${dial}</pre>
      <p hidden> ${path}</p>
      Now, consider the following social norm: 
      <pre>${norm}</pre>
      
      Does the conversation scenario [ <i><font style="color:#00008B">entails</font> / <font style="color:#00008B">is irrelevant to</font> / <font style="color:#00008B">violates</font></i> ] the given social norm? 
      <crowd-input name="entailment_verdict" placeholder="Type: 'entails', 'is irrelevant to', or 'violates' (please use one of these three terminologies, no other wording)" required></crowd-input>
      <br>
      Please provide a 1-2 sentence, detailed and insightful explanation for your answer above. 
      <crowd-input name="explanation" placeholder="Type your detailed and insightful input here... (simply 'N/A' or 'This is irrelevant' would not provide sufficient context)" required></crowd-input>
      Lastly, copy and paste the span of text from the input dialogue that best highlights why the conversation scenario <i>entails</i>, <i>is irrelevant to</i>, or <i>violates</i> the given social norm. 
      <crowd-input name="highlight" placeholder="Paste the relevant span of text taken directly from the input dialogue here" required></crowd-input>
      <!-- <crowd-input name="utterance" placeholder="The conversation scenario [entails / is irrelevant to / violates] because..." required></crowd-input>-->
